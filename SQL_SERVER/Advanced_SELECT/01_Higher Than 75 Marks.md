## Problem

 Query the Name of any student in **STUDENTS** who scored higher than _**75**_ Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
 
 **Input Format:**
 
 The **STUDENTS** table is described as follows: 

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12896/1443815243-94b941f556-1.png)

The Name column only contains uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

    Ashley
    Julia
    Belvet
    
**Explanation**

Only Ashley, Julia, and Belvet have Marks > **_75_** . If you look at the last three characters of each of their names, there are no duplicates and 'ley' < 'lia' < 'vet'.

## CODE:

    SELECT NAME FROM STUDENTS
    WHERE MARKS > 75
    ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME,3), ID;
    
## Output:
